# Finding-Waldo
The scripts used for our MATH 398 project in Spring 2019

The goal of our project was to use the SSD Algorithm and AWS SageMaker to train a machine learning model that detects the Waldo character from Martin Handford's Where's Waldo children's book series. Included in this repository is the code we used to train our model.
